# All Ports Tours – Our Story

## Company Origins  
Founded in **2003** in **Springfield, USA**, by siblings **David Carter** and **Emily Carter**,  
All Ports Tours began with a mission to combine **modern technology** with the timeless appeal of ocean travel.  

In 2006, the company introduced its first ship, the **Pastry Princess**, marking the launch of the **Croissant Cruises™** brand.  
Over the years, the fleet has grown to include the **Buttery Breeze**, **Flaky Voyager**, **Crescent Serenity**, and  
the flagship **Doughlight Dreamer**.  

From day one, the company has focused on delivering **comfort, reliability, and memorable experiences**,  
positioning itself as a forward-thinking cruise operator.

## Operations & Innovation  
All Ports Tours has pioneered a **modernized approach to cruise operations**, with a strong emphasis on  
technology-enabled comfort. This model allows for consistent guest experiences across the fleet, ensuring  
that every voyage is seamless and stress-free.  

Through its central headquarters in Springfield, the company provides oversight for fleet operations while  
allowing onboard staff to focus entirely on creating exceptional guest experiences.

## Navigating Challenges  
The global pandemic in 2020 temporarily paused operations across the cruise industry. During this period,  
All Ports Tours reinforced its long-term vision: investing in operational resilience and enhancing guest  
comfort for the future.  

The company has since returned to near full operations, continuing its commitment to safe, reliable,  
and modern travel at sea.
